I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Information Systems with a specialization in Data Science and Analytics from the University of Maryland - [Robert H. Smith School of Business](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/). My past professional experiences and projects have equipped me with immense knowledge and expertise in the field of Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Business Intelligence, and Software Development. I also believe my extra-curricular and co-curricular activities throughout my undergraduate studies have helped me develop my soft skills. I am currently seeking new opportunities that require a perfect blend of the skills I possess.
